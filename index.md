This is a sample page for testing out Markdown formatting and creating a GitHub Pages -page.

# Introduction

Markdown is a *markup* language for formatting plaintext documents.
It was created in 2004 and has since become one of the most popular markdown languages in the world.

Markdown is designed to have a very readable formatting syntax, meaning it should be possible to look at the source markdown file and be able to read it without a barrage of tags or formatting instructions.

GitHub supports Markdown in the form of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). 

# Basic formatting in GFM

- **bold text** with syntax `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`
- *italic text* with syntax `*italic text*` or `_italic text_`
- ~~strikethrough~~ with syntax `~~strikethrough~~`
- **bold _and italic_** can be nested with syntax `**bold _and italic_**`
- <sub>Subscript</sub> text with syntax `<sub>Subscript</sub>`
- <sup>Superscript</sup> text with syntax `<sup>Superscript</sup>`
- <ins>Underline</ins> with syntax `<ins>Underline</ins>`

### Quotes

Syntax for quoting text is 
`> This is a text quote`

> This is a text quote

Quoting code can be done in two ways:

- The syntax for quoting single-line code blocks, eg. `import java.util.HashMap` is ``` `import java.util.HashMap` ```
- To quote multi-line code blocks, eg.
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```
,
wrap your code inside triple backticks (```)
````
```
this is a
multi-line
code block!
```
````

### Links

[Links](https://github.com/) can be added to your text by wrapping the text in brackets `[]` and the URL in parentheses `()`: `[Links](https://github.com/)`

## Conclusion

There are a lot of other ways to format text in Markdown, but going through all of them would make this document unnecessarily long. This was more-so an exercise on GitHub Pages rather than Markdown language.
